A one-liner command to (re-)construct my workspace, which includes three popular components:

- [Oh My Tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux)
- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org/)


## Requirements

Bash and Zsh (aka Z shell). Yes, that's it. Of course you will also need Internet connection.


## Install

The one-liner command
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ljishen/workspace/main/install.sh | bash
```
